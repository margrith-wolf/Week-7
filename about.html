        Hello! My name is Margrith Wolf and I am an aspiring elite off-road cyclist. 
        Unlike most professionals, I didn't pick up bike racing from a young age, or find NICA, or any
        other development team. I'm almost 28 years old and probably considered "old" to be starting my
        run at a professional career.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not new to sports though! I ran triathlon for the University of Oregon my freshman year, before finding
        the sports of CrossFit and Olympic Weightlifting, competing for nearly eight years at an elite national level. 
    </p>
    <p>
        2022 marked my first year of competitive bike racing and I competed in large well-known races such as The Belgian
        Waffle Ride, Rebecca's Private Idaho and Spirit World 100. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My commitment to this sport is absolute and at the ripe old age of (almost) 28, I have my sights set on joining the 
        elite ranks of off-road cylcing. 
    </p>
